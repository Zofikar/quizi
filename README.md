# Small side project with bad UI created with create-t3-app

This is small project for quiz web app with option to create and save quizes to database.
UI is "not very good" and requires work but it's what you get when you forget to sleep.
Functionally it works and thats what matters, maybe if I actually will ever need it again I will work on UI.
